# GitHub Actions for DigitalOcean

This action enables you to interact with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) services via [the `doctl` command-line client](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl).

## Usage

As an example, one common use case is retrieving the credentials for a Kubernetes cluster hosted on DigitalOcean for use in a deployment workflow:


```hcl
action "Save DigitalOcean kubeconfig" {
  needs = ["Push image to Docker Hub"]
  uses = "andrewsomething/digitalocean-action/doctl@master"
  secrets = ["DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN"]
  env = {
    CLUSTER_NAME = "example"
  }
  args = ["kubernetes", "cluster", "kubeconfig", "save", "$CLUSTER_NAME"]
}
```

See [this reposirory](https://github.com/andrewsomething/example-doctl-action) for a full end-to-end example that also demonstrates building the Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and using `kubectl` to deploy to the Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean.

### Secrets

- `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` â€“ **Required** A DigitalOcean personal access token ([more info](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/)).

### Environment variables

We provide defaults for the following, these may also be overridden:

- `DIGITALOCEAN_OUTPUT_FORMAT`- **Optional** doctl's output output format, defaults to `json`

By default, this action is configured to save output in JSON format to `${HOME}/${GITHUB_ACTION}.${DIGITALOCEAN_OUTPUT_FORMAT}`for consumption by downstream actions.
